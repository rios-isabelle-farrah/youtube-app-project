          <p>
            As a selected Fellow at Pursuit, an intensive 12-month software
            engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate, I am a Full Stack
            Web Developer. I was hooked after creating my first text based
            adventure game using Javascript. <br></br>With a passion for helping
            others, my goal is to apply my skills to develop software programs
            that are accessible and user-friendly. I want to help people enjoy
            their life rather than struggle with a software for hours and get
            stressed about it. This is a start of a new path for me where I can
            thrive and help others thrive as well.

            My love for problem-solving has led me on path as a software web
            developer. As a selected Fellow at Pursuit, an intensive 12-month
            software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate, I am
            currently honing my skills as a coder. In addition, my immersion
            into the tech industry world has shaped my perspective of how I can
            leverage my love of collaboration and problem-solving to real-world
            challenges. <br></br>I am passionate about special education
            advocacy and accessibility of information and technology. As a
            mother to a brilliant child on the autism spectrum, augmentative and
            alternative communication (AAC) devices are a huge part of my daily
            life and I want to use this experience to contribute to the creation
            of more inclusive assistive technology that meet the communication
            needs of children and adults of all backgrounds.

            My passion lies in creating luxurious systems that greatly improve
            the user's experience.<br></br>As a multi-hyphenate, I strive to
            concatenate my growing knowledge as a software engineer with my
            expertise in garment construction and supply chain management. My
            work with and for historically, underrepresented populations informs
            my approach to accessibility. Coupled with a keen understanding of
            design thinking, this nuanced perspective shepherds innovative
            products that augment equity and champion sustainability.
